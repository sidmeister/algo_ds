/**
 * Created by srathi on 12/10/16.
 * he Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence
 * such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.
 * For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.
 * Input  : arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
 Output : Length of LIS = 3
 The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20

 Input  : arr[] = {3, 2}
 Output : Length of LIS = 1
 The longest increasing subsequences are {3} and {2}

 Input : arr[] = {50, 3, 10, 7, 40, 80}
 Output : Length of LIS = 4
 The longest increasing subsequence is {3, 7, 40, 80}
